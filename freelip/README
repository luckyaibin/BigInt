FreeLIP is the large integer package used in the global collaboration to
factor the 129-digit number RSA-129 and thereby solve a 17-year old
challenge in cryptography.

This software was originally written by Arjen K Lenstra
(arjen.lenstra@citicorp.com) but is now maintained by Paul Leyland
(pcl@oucs.ox.ac.uk).  Bug reports, ports to novel architectures,
enhancements, suggestions, etc should be directed to pcl.

This package may be copied, redistributed and used for any
NON-COMMERCIAL purpose but the copyright notices must remain intact.
Neither Citicorp, Oxford University nor any of the authors offer any
warranty whatsoever.

The V1.1 release of freeLIP is adapted from the RSA-129 package -- a few
minor bug fixes have been incorporated by Paul Leyland, and it has been
ported to DEC Alpha and Microsoft WinNT. The package consists of this
README, the source code lip.c and lip.h; full PostScript documentation,
a configuration utility liptimer.c and a wish-list of desirable
enhancements called TODO.

Differences from V1.0
---------------------

There have been no major changes.

A nasty bug in zxxeucl has been fixed; previously zfecm() etc could
return incorrect answers, loop endlessly, or crash with a memory error.

zsqufof() now works correctly (or, at least, better) on 64-bit machines.

Sundry memory leaks have been plugged.

The code now compiles better under Windows NT.  Several internal
variables had to be renamed to avoid clashes.  None are user-visible.

The Makefile is marginally (though only marginally) less primitive.
