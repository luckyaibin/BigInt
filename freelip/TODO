The wish-list:

    Write assembler primitives for common architectures

    Split up into multiple modules and make an ar(1) library

    Write a timer to select optimum compilation constants automagically

    Fix minor bug in output routines where the first line is wrong length

    Make some #defines visible (transfer from lip.c to lip.h)
